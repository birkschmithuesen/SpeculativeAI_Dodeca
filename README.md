# SpeculativeArtificialIntelligence

An aesthetic research series to audiovisually translate the behaviour of neural networks

Two independent neural networks are trained with sound->visual and visual->sound associations. They are connected to each other in a closed circuit over the analog world with a speaker->microphone and light object->camera. <br> This repos contains the visual->sound part. For sound->visual visit [the repository](https://github.com/birkschmithuesen/SpeculativeAI_Interspace).

# SpeculativeArtificialIntelligence

The aesthetic experiment Speculative Artificial Intelligence investigates the autonomous creativity of AI systems. Communication between two AI takes place in a human comprehensible range through direct audiovisual translation. The systems are interconnected to create a closed circuit in which both AI interact. Visitors can follow the exchange and intuitively experience the behavior of the neural networks. One system can "hear" sounds and "create" images, the other system can "see" images and "play" sounds.

This creates a feedback loop between two machines that creates their endless audiovisual composition. In order to produce the concrete aesthetics of neural networks, the audiovisual translation is as direct as possible and not translated into representations of our habitual environment.

The state of the neural networks is reflected in simple light brightness and pure audio signals. The uninterpreted raw data create its own aesthetics and show the processes within the AI. Both networks work together to develop an abstract, audiovisual language. Visitors can intervene in the communication between the AI systems.
